# AUTOMATED TESTING TECHNOLOGIES

### Why Automated Testing?
 - To ensure that delivered software is free of defects / bug for the benefit of consumer.
 - It is the best way to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and coverage of the software developed.
 - It saves time and money
    - Software testing needs to be repeated often during the development cycles to ensure quality, so everytime source code is modified, testing should be repeated. Automated tests can reduce the time to run repetitive tests from days to hours.

## Preferred for automation testing are the following:
